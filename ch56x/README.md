# ch56x
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to CH56X peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.ch56x]
version = "0.1.7"
features = ["ch56x", "critical-section"]

[dependencies.riscv]
version = "0.10.1"
features = ["critical-section-single-hart"]
```

In your code:

```rust
use ch56x::ch56x;

let mut peripherals = ch56x::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
