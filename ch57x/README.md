# ch57x
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to CH57X peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

[documentation]: https://docs.rs/ch57x/latest/ch57x/

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.ch57x]
version = "0.1.5"
features = ["ch57x"]
```

The `rt` feature is enabled by default and brings in support for `riscv-rt`.
To disable, specify `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.

In your code:

```rust
use ch57x::ch57x;

let mut peripherals = ch57x::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
